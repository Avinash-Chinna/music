# music
A simple music player application which access audio files with external Storage.
I had used the Dexter android extenal library, which is an Android library that simplifies the process of requesting permissions at runtime.
Dexter gives free permission code from my activities and lets me write that logic anywhere I want.
This is the only one library which is used externally to this application.
